# Simetric Encryption Chip based on A5/1 Cipher Algorithm

This project aims to design and implement a hardware encryption chip based on the A5/1 symmetric stream cipher, widely used in mobile communication systems. The work focuses on exploring the core principles of symmetric cryptography, such as XOR operations and Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs), to build an efficient, low-complexity, and lightweight encryption system suitable for embedded and low-power applications.

The chip was programmed in Amaranth HDL, a Python-based hardware description language that enables modular and readable digital architecture design. Using this environment, the main components of the algorithm, namely the Shift Register, the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), and the Finite State Machine (FSM), were modeled and simulated to verify correct encryption and decryption behavior. This implementation serves as an educational and experimental tool for studying cryptographic algorithms in hardware, emphasizing the balance between security, efficiency, and structural simplicity.
